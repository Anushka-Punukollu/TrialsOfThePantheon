## Game Backstory ðŸ“œ
In the realm of Olympus, a fierce war has erupted among the gods, causing chaos and devastation in its wake. The source of this conflict lies in a missing treasure that holds immense power and significance to gods. This extraordinary artifact, known as the "Chest of Ancients," is said to contain ancient relics capable of altering the balance of power in Olympus. You are a demigod chosen by  Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom to retrieve the Chest and the valuable object in it. Legend has it that the Chest of Ancients holds the first key to resolving the escalating conflict among the gods. It is believed that opening the chest will reveal ancient wisdom and insights that can guide divine beings toward reconciliation and unity.

Armed with Athena's blessing and guidance, you venture forth into the treacherous realm of Olympus. Your journey will take you through perilous trials and challenges, testing your strength, intelligence, and courage. Along the way, you will encounter both allies and adversaries, each with their own motivations and agendas in the war. Will you prove yourself worthy of Athena's trust and bring an end to the war that threatens to tear Olympus apart? The answer lies within you as you embark on this epic quest to retrieve Athena's chest and unlock the secrets that can bring about a new era of peace.
